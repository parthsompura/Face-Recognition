# AndroidFaceRecognition
This is the simplest android application which recognizes the faces from images using Google Vision API. Face Detection is a leap forward from the previous Android FaceDetector/Face API. It's designed to better detect human faces in images and video for easier editing. It's smart enough to detect faces even at different orientations -- so if your subject's head is turned sideways, it can detect it. Specific landmarks can also be detected on faces, such as the eyes, the nose, and the edges of the lips.
